    "# Problem set 3: Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this problem set is to compare the sentiments associated with male and female characters in a small corpus of 41 novels. \n",
    "\n",
    "This task has a bit in common with Erin Davis's work on the adjectives and body parts associated with male and female characters, though our task is significantly less complex (because we are not doing dependency parsing in order to associate specific words with individual character references).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the approach you should implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each text in the corpus ...\n",
    "1. Break the text into sentences and tokenize each sentence.\n",
    "1. Assign a subject gender to each sentence by counting occurrences of gendered words (\"he\", \"she\", etc.). Refine these lists as you see fit. \n",
    "  1. Optional: devise ways to treat gender as a non-binary variable.\n",
    "1. Assign sentiment scores to each sentence using the 10 sentiment types included in the NRC EmoLex lexicon (\"anticipation\", \"disgust\", \"trust\", etc.).\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean sentiment score(s) for the sentences in the text that you identified as male-centric and female-centric. \n",
    "  1. Optional: If you chose to work with non-binary gender assignments, devise an appropriate way to group gender-similar sentences using your assignments. \n",
    "1. Compare your grouped sentiment scores among the novels in the corpus. \n",
    "1. Write roughly one paragraph of analysis and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next block of code contains some variables and import statements. **Make sure your variables point to the correct files on your system.** Get these files from the course GitHub site."
