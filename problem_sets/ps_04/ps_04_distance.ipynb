    "As noted in class, Euclidean distances are strongly influenced by document length. One way to minimize the impact of length is to *normalize* our vectors.\n",

    "To normalize our vectors, we need to switch to `TfidfVectorizer` (or else be prepared to do some math on our own). `TfidfVectorizer` has two helpful features that are not present in `CountVectorizer`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `TfidfVectorizer` applies selectable normalization to the calculated vectors. This prevents long documents from being far away from short documents simply because the documents contain different numbers of words.\n",
    "  1. There are two built-in normalization methods. `'l1'` produces vectors the elements of which sum to 1. `'l2'` produces vectors whose *squared* elements sum to 1.\n",
    "  1. One sees `l2` normalization used more often than `l1` for machine learning tasks. **In general**(!), *l2* produces better fits because it reduces the influence of outlying data points more aggressively, while *l1* produces sparser features (that is, feature vectors with more values that are close to zero). Sparse features can be desirable in some cases (feature selection and interpretation can be easier with sparse features, for instance).\n",
    "1. `TfidfVectorizer` allows us to apply [TF-IDF weighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf), if desired. This is a method of downweighting words that appear in many documents (on the theory that words shared by many documents are less likely to tell us much about the distinctive content of any one document than are words that are not so widely shared). TF-IDF is a classic preprocessing step in many information retrieval tasks, though it's unclear how much it helps when assessing document similarity. Since it's a selectable flag in `TfidfVectorizer`, we can try it out and see what difference it makes.\n",
