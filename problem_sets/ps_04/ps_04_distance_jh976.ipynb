I think this is the case because in all of the sentences but the first one, the animals are doing an action. In the first sentence, it just describes what and to the extent the cat likes/dislikes something. This already distinguishes sentence 0 from sentence 4 but, sentence 0 also only includes one animal while sentence 4 includes 2."

    "I think comparing the unique words is interesting to look at since in general, what I precieved as most similar still stays the same- which could mean we inherently look for difference in unique words to compare sentences. However, when looking it like this the distances seem a little off. What I mean by this is that this method reduces the sentences to a bunch of words, and comparing sentences in that way will have you a faulty perception of distance from each other. For example, sentence 0 & 1 are the most distant from one another because they have the least unique words in common, however, contextually other sentences could seem more different. Although this same insight could be made from the Cosine distances, I think the Cosine metric does better in showing differences as it shows that the last sentence is basically on a class of its own and it is so different from the other sentences.

    "\n",
    "As noted in class, Euclidean distances are strongly influenced by document length. One way to minimize the impact of length is to *normalize* our vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To normalize our vectors, we need to switch to `TfidfVectorizer` (or else be prepared to do some math on our own). `TfidfVectorizer` has two helpful features that are not present in `CountVectorizer`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `TfidfVectorizer` applies selectable normalization to the calculated vectors. This prevents long documents from being far away from short documents simply because the documents contain different numbers of words.\n",
    "  1. There are two built-in normalization methods. `'l1'` produces vectors the elements of which sum to 1. `'l2'` produces vectors whose *squared* elements sum to 1.\n",
    "  1. One sees `l2` normalization used more often than `l1` for machine learning tasks. **In general**(!), *l2* produces better fits because it reduces the influence of outlying data points more aggressively, while *l1* produces sparser features (that is, feature vectors with more values that are close to zero). Sparse features can be desirable in some cases (feature selection and interpretation can be easier with sparse features, for instance).\n",
    "1. `TfidfVectorizer` allows us to apply [TF-IDF weighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf), if desired. This is a method of downweighting words that appear in many documents (on the theory that words shared by many documents are less likely to tell us much about the distinctive content of any one document than are words that are not so widely shared). TF-IDF is a classic preprocessing step in many information retrieval tasks, though it's unclear how much it helps when assessing document similarity. Since it's a selectable flag in `TfidfVectorizer`, we can try it out and see what difference it makes.\n",
    "\n",

    "Well first off, I just used the already set TfidfVectorizer function, and since we were using a larger bodies of text for vectorizing and weighing, I thought it was important to set use_df to True. This, in my opinion, is important because it doesn't necessarily give more weight to words that more frequently show up, also as I stated before, I think this gives a much clearer and better picture of the uses of TFIDF weighting. For the stopwords, when I inspected the documentations and found that 'english' was the only compatible use of stopword removal, so that is what I stuck with. After setting up the function, I used the same methods from above and analyzed the Euclidean and Cosine metrics for distance. Looking at the distances I found that that interestingly enough, the last book (*Middlemarch*) was the most similar to all of the texts (looking at it from both cosine and euclidean- which makes sense since large body of text less weight on more frequent words + cosine already shouldn't really take into the account the magnitude of the words). I think this could indicate that most of the books took inspiration from *Middlemarch* which could justify the similarities. I find it odd that these books didn't take inspiration from *Pride and Prejudice* which is a much older book, but I think this could be explained by the fact that it was significantly older than the rest of the books and maybe as a fellow British author, George Eliot did take inspiration (posisbly explaining why their bodies of text are so similar) and since Eliot's novel is much newer (but still old) all of the other authors had greater accessibility to Eliot's novel than Austen's. Also, I was not sure if there was much of an impact regarding the genre of the novel nor the gender of the author. There were slight indications of a trend or something of a correlation, but this is hard to say with the use of 5 books. All of the speculations I made were grounded in the similarity of **word usage**. I think tfidf improved the results a lot, but maybe taking out numbers and or abbreviated words would improve the results. Although I made speculations of the novels above, I do not think the methods above are strong enough evidence for saying anything I said is right or can be proven or anything of that realm (I just thought it was fun to speculate some ideas).
