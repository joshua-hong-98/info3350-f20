    "Examine the differences between British and American fiction in the class-curated literary corpus. Apply statistical measures and calculate feature importance in a simple classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Details\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work with a corpus of 131 volumes of fiction by British and American authors. These volumes are taken from the class corpus, so you'll need to download a copy of the texts from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lbeZiBAVCzjCWojCK8mfmELa-Q8FMNUm?usp=sharing) or from GitHub and save them somewhere on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have three tasks for this problem set, all of which depend on comparing British-authored to American-authored books:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean frequency per 100,000 words, as well as the upper and lower bounds of a 95% confidence interval, for the terms `['color', 'honor', 'center', 'fish', 'person']` in each national subcorpus\n",
    "    1. Perform this calculation analyticaly, that is, using the observed sample means and standard deviations.\n",
    "    1. Calculate the same quantities via bootstrap, using 1,000 or more iterations.\n",
    "    1. In both cases, print your results in a tabular format.\n",
    "2. Perform a *t*-test to compare the mean frequency of each of these terms between British and American texts. Report the test statistic and *p*-value for each comparison. Note which means are significantly different at the *p*<0.05 level.\n",
    "3. Perform a logistic regression classification of each volume as British or American. \n",
    "    1. Your final features should be the 25 most informative (as measured by the mutual information criterion) token unigrams.\n",
    "    1. Report your 10-fold cross-validated F1 score before and after restricting your input features to the 25 most-informative token types.\n",
    "    1. Calculate the *importance* of the 25 top features for classification as measured by permutation importance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* See code stubs below for step-by-step guidance. \n",
    "* Consult, too, the lecture notes on explainability and on statistics.\n",
