    "    * Attend at 11:15 if possible, else watch recording of the 11:15 section.\n",

    "## Mauch et al., \"The Evolution of Popular Music\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Describe the corpus** with which the researchers are working. That is, what is their input data? \n",
    "    * How does this dataset relate to the social question they want to answer?\n",
    "    * Is the fit between question and data a good one?\n",
    "1. How do you explain the study's finding that popular music changed with the arrival of hip-hop in ... 1991? Doesn't the **historical timing** seem a little off?\n",
    "1. To what extent are the paper's methods **supervised or unsupervised**? \n",
    "    * Why have the authors adopted the approach they have?\n",
    "    * Can you imagine a version of the experiment that would make heavier use of the opposite class of methods?\n",
    "1. If you were interested in studying the evolution of music **today and in the future**, how (if at all) would you want to modify the corpus or methods used here?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Norvig, \"On Chomsky and the Two Cultures of Statistical Learning\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*NB.* Peter Norvig is the Director of Research at Google. Noam Chomsky is sometimes called the \"father of modern lingusitics\" and is a prominent public intellectual. This is a debate between heavyweights.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What do you take to be Norvig's primary criticism of Chomsky? \n",
    "1. Why do you suppose I assigned this reading? Take as a given that we are not, in this class, especially interested in debates internal to linguistics, but that we **are** interested in debates about the proper role of computation in the humanities."
