    "1. Does this piece use supervised or unsupervised methods? \n",
    "    1. Did the authors make the right call about the methods used?\n",
    "1. Computational methods seem to have landed on different features than those that humans use to differentiate genres. What do you make of this?\n",
    "    1. How could the methods be modified to capture aspects of human judgment about genre differences?\n",
    "1. Several people noted that generic differences and historical differences are not cleanly separable. How might we assess the effects of shifting historical baselines on other aspects of textual difference?"
